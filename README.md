## Hi, I'm Jack!

<p>Welcome to my Github! I am a software engineer, data nerd, classical musician, and tennis fanatic interested in how software meets and adapts to our ever-changing, diverse world.</p>

<p>My journey in programming and data science has kept me always learning with experience in JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, SQL and R. I strive to better understand and discover how programs relate to human data, and make software an experience for everyone, even if your last name is Null.</p>
